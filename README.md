# tritone
A shuffle-based music player for Android, designed for embedded entertainment systems.

Currently still under development, but debug builds are available in `android/build/outputs/apk`.

Tritone does not yet import music - it is preloaded with several public domain pieces. Although preloading Creative Commons Attribution music is a possibility, it would require programming in a form of attribution, and this is only for demo purposes in the first place, so it's likely to stick to preloaded music for now.

More platforms coming soon!
