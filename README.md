# tritone
A shuffle-based music player for Android, designed for embedded entertainment systems.

Currently still under development, but debug builds are available in `android/build/outputs/apk`.

Tritone does not yet import music - it is preloaded with several public domain pieces. Although preloading Creative Commons Attribution music is a possibility, it would require programming in a form of attribution, and this is only for demo purposes in the first place, so it's likely to stick to preloaded music for now.

More platforms coming soon!

Tritone is available under the Mozilla Public License, Version 2.0. However, I ask, as a courtesy, that you not submit exact clones of it to app stores without making significant changes or asking further permission.
